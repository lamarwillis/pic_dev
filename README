PIC dev README

This porject is designed to descibe an environment for conducting
PIC development.

For the uninitiated, a PIC is a Programmable Interface Controller. These
microcontrollers are electronic circuits that can be programmed to carry
out a range of tasks. Although many types are available from several vendors,
this project is solely interested in a set of PIC devices sold by MicroChip,
currently the PIC16F84A and the PIC16F628A.
