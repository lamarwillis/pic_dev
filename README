PIC dev README

This porject is designed to descibe an environment for conducting
PIC development.

For the uninitiated, a PIC is a Programmable Interface Controller. These
microcontrollers are electronic circuits that can be programmed to carry
out a range of tasks. Although many types are available from several vendors,
this project is solely interested in a set of PIC devices sold by MicroChip,
currently the PIC16F84A and the PIC16F628A.

This project currently consists of the following components:
README: this file
LICENSE: MIT License
Dockerfile: defines am Ubuntu 16.04-based container for PIC development,
    primarily consisting of gputils and gpsim
Vagrantfile: provides Docker management, currently for Linux hosts
HostVagrantfile: host-agnostic Docker management, not yet tested
